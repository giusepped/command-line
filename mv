The mv command can move a file from a directory to another one. It can also be used to rename a file. 
It takes two arguments: the first argument is the file that you need to move/rename and the second argument 
is the new location with the new name of the file(optional).

Example of usage. To move the file 'example' to the parent directory and call it 'example1':

mv example ../example1
