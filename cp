The cp command can be used to make a copy of a file that you can put in the working directory or into another location.
It takes two arguments: the first one is the original file and the second one is the copied one.

Example of usage. Copy the file example1 into the grand-parent directory and call the copy 'example2':

cp example1 ../../example2
